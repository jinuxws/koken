# About Koken
## Koken is a WIP not ready for production, its only in alpha stage.
Koken is a self-hosted recipe manager and meal planner, built with FastAPI backend and a Vue frontend. This makes a enjoyable user experience for the whole family as well as easy for developers. You can add your own reciepes or easily add reciepes from various recipe providers using our recipe-scrapers, (current list will be update as morerecipe-scrapers are added).
